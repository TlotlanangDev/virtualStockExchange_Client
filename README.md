# VirtualStockExchange_Client
The virtual stock exchange is not just a java project but it is a solution to a problem faced by many entrepreneurs in the country who want to start or expand their businesses, the platform is a fundraising platform with a stock Exchange theme, people will be able to list their ideas or prototypes to raise funds from other entrepreneurs to start those businesses, people who already have businesses will raise more money to expand their businesses. The platform will not be able to sell shares like a normal stock exchange because of regulatory reasons, but it will allow entrepreneurs to support one another.
